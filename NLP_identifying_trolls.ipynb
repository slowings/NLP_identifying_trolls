        "# Overview\n",
        "For this capstone project I will be working on identifying online harassment using NLP.  Why focus on harassment?  Well, for starters, it's a problem that affects a quarter of the population in the U.S.  Additionally, according to a [2021 Pew research poll]( (https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/)), 79% of respondants \"say social media companies are doing an only fair or poor job at addressing online harassment or bullying on their platforms.\"  Our goal is to construct a virtual moderator, or vMOD, a NLP model that is capable of predicting if a comment is harassment or not, and automatically blocks users who are sending hateful comments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Fully 33% of women under 35 say they have been sexually harassed online\", For those who identify as LBGTQA, \"51% have been targeted for more severe forms of online abuse.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Among adults who have been harassed online, roughly half of women (47%) say they think they have encountered harassment online because of their gender, whereas 18% of men who have been harassed online say the same. Similarly, about half or more Black (54%) or Hispanic online harassment targets (47%) say they were harassed due to their race or ethnicity, compared with 17% of White targets.\"\n",

        "# Data Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "We've already lowercased the letters of our corpus, and now we'll untertake our next step, tokenizing our corpus, or splitting each comment into a series of words.  We'll have to make some decisions now about whether we remove stop words, what kinds of regex expressions we should use to clean the comments, if we should stem, lemmatize, or leave our text data as is before we come to our next step, vectorization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because our dataset is quite large, we'll begin by removing stop words.  We'll do this because large datasets become highly dimensionsal after they've been vectorized, and to minimize processing times we'll need to reduce the amount of tokens we pass in to our vector.  Removing stop words- the most common words in english that have little value in this use case, will help us do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll also use a regex expression to clean up some of the comments.  As we could see in our datatframe, there's many examples of strange punctuation that could adversly affect our model's performance, and we'll want to edit those out as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll hold off on stemming or lemmatizing for now.  If our results from our initial models are unsatisfactory, we'll circle back to stemming our tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll begin with our import statements for this portion of our exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Notes:\n",
        "* Is basic tokenization enough, or do we need to support special edge cases through the use of regex?\n",
        "*Do we use the entire vocabulary, or just limit the model to a subset of the most frequently used words? If so, how many?\n",
        "* Do we engineer other features, such as bigrams, or POS tags, or Mutual Information Scores?\n",
        "* What sort of vectorization should we use in our model? Boolean Vectorization? Count Vectorization? TF-IDF? More advanced vectorization strategies such as Word2Vec?\n",
        "\n",
        "Another common decision point when working with text data is exactly what features to include in the dataset. As we saw in a previous lab, NLTK makes it quite easy to do things like generate part-of-speech tags for words, or create word or character-level n-grams. In general, there's no great answer for exactly which features will improve the performance of your model, and which won't. This means that your best bet is to experiment, and treat the entire project as an iterative process! When working with text data, don't be afraid to try modeling on alternative forms of the text data, such as bigrams or n-grams. Similarly, we encourage you to explore how adding in additional features such as POS tags or mutual information scores affect the overall model performance.\n",
