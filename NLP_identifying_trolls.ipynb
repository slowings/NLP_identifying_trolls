        "# Overview\n",
        "For this capstone project I will be working on identifying online harassment using NLP.  Why focus on harassment?  Well, for starters, it's a problem that affects a quarter of the population in the U.S.  Additionally, according to a [2021 Pew research poll]( (https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/)), 79% of respondants \"say social media companies are doing an only fair or poor job at addressing online harassment or bullying on their platforms.\"  Our goal is to construct a virtual moderator, or vMOD, a NLP model that is capable of predicting if a comment is harassment or not, and automatically blocks users who are sending hateful comments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Fully 33% of women under 35 say they have been sexually harassed online\", For those who identify as LBGTQA, \"51% have been targeted for more severe forms of online abuse.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Among adults who have been harassed online, roughly half of women (47%) say they think they have encountered harassment online because of their gender, whereas 18% of men who have been harassed online say the same. Similarly, about half or more Black (54%) or Hispanic online harassment targets (47%) say they were harassed due to their race or ethnicity, compared with 17% of White targets.\"\n",

We'll have to make some decisions now about whether we remove stop words, what kinds of regex expressions we should use to clean the comments, if we should stem, lemmatize, or leave our text data as is before we come to our next step, vectorization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because our dataset is quite large, we'll begin by removing stop words.  We'll do this because large datasets become highly dimensionsal after they've been vectorized, and to minimize processing times we'll need to reduce the amount of tokens we pass in to our vector.  Removing stop words- the most common words in english that have little value in this use case, will help us do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll also use a regex expression to clean up some of the comments.  As we could see in our datatframe, there's many examples of strange punctuation that could adversly affect our model's performance, and we'll want to edit those out as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll hold off on stemming or lemmatizing for now.  If our results from our initial models are unsatisfactory, we'll circle back to stemming our tokens.\n",

        "### Notes:\n",
        "* Is basic tokenization enough, or do we need to support special edge cases through the use of regex?\n",
        "*Do we use the entire vocabulary, or just limit the model to a subset of the most frequently used words? If so, how many?\n",
        "* Do we engineer other features, such as bigrams, or POS tags, or Mutual Information Scores?\n",
        "* What sort of vectorization should we use in our model? Boolean Vectorization? Count Vectorization? TF-IDF? More advanced vectorization strategies such as Word2Vec?\n",
        "\n",
        "Another common decision point when working with text data is exactly what features to include in the dataset. As we saw in a previous lab, NLTK makes it quite easy to do things like generate part-of-speech tags for words, or create word or character-level n-grams. In general, there's no great answer for exactly which features will improve the performance of your model, and which won't. This means that your best bet is to experiment, and treat the entire project as an iterative process! When working with text data, don't be afraid to try modeling on alternative forms of the text data, such as bigrams or n-grams. Similarly, we encourage you to explore how adding in additional features such as POS tags or mutual information scores affect the overall model performance.\n",

(i haven\\'t yet worked in \"\"no original research\"\".) wp:nor says that we mustn\\'t integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. we can integrate information, so long as we don\\'t arrive at new theories. another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. the more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. \\n\\ngetting down to details, the predators and editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. the bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about bauer. i\\'m not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. however i would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. the sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. the website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. \\n\\noverall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. attack articles are not encouraged. while we must show our subjects \"\"warts and all\"\" we shouldn\\'t enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. balance is a part of npov. - \\n\\n\"\"but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources.\"\" there no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. it is alleged the website takdown was instigated by bauer. it isn\\'t clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the ip are not known. it was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. i don\\'t see how that can be objective. \\n\\n bauer \\ni\\'m sorry i did not get back to you about the usenet stuff et al., but i\\'ve been somewhat overloaded at work. personally, i think the article is better now than when i first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn\\'t seem like a lynch mob. y\\'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . i\\'m glad to help and try and make the article neater, and i don\\'t mean to sound brusque in the summary field, but there was a lot to cram in there. thanks for the note, i appreciate it!   \\n i would say karen saying i\\'ve called her names is an out and out fabrication. i\\'ve never done any such thing. \\n\\n\"\"or whether it\\'s because he\\'s been able to insult me and call me names on wikipedia, repeatedly and without consequences\"\"\\n\\ni\\'ve accused her and jule of carrying the water for tnh and absolutewrite and they have. that isn\\'t namecalling by a long stretch. i\\'m really weary of these attacks over this. this is mob rule. while avi seems genuine, she\\'s hanging with a tough insulting tribe. the threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. blaming me won\\'t make my points any less valid. nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. it\\'s the internet equivalent of stoning. \\n\\nthis is not a fabrication. i get awfully tired of being called a troll, or part of a mob or cult or \"\"group troll,\"\" or a \"\"self-interested partisan,\"\" or a \"\"blog comment commando,\"\" or other things i could point at if i wanted to depress myself. you also made a \"\"theoretical\"\" comment about me being \"\"nosy, fat and ugly.\"\" putting the word \"\"if\"\" in front of it doesn\\'t make it any less of an insult. i\\'ve tried to be polite to you, and will continue to do so, but this is the response. and, please notice, like abi (avi is avraham the admin, abi the ml commenter who believes in kindness) i counseled against piling on.  | talk | contribs \\n\\nthose are not ad hominem names karen. yet you\\'ve linked to a thread where you and teresa caled me a psycho. you should hear what she said in private when i asked not to be spoken of negatively in threads on making light. it\\'s obvious you two are pro-tnh and absolutewrite. that\\'s self-interest and backed up by the fact that you run to her for counseling. well, avi can make her own decisons about it then can\\'t sh',\n",

              " \"topics \\n • \\t the holocaust \\n • \\t anne frank diary \\n • \\t change of the freedom writers \\n\\n the  holocaust  \\n\\n the holocaust occurred during world war ii when adolf hitler was the dictator of germany. the holocaust is basically when millions of jews were murdered during wwii and were intensely discriminated by hitler and the nazi’s. however many of the jews had resided in parts of europe and many of them were residing in germany but many of them were once again murdered by the germans because hitler plotted on disappearing all the jews that were in the country.  this reminds me of how ms. gruwell from freedom writers encouraged her students to learn and investigate about the holocaust because not all of them knew about it or even believed it even happened and she wanted them to have confidence and knowledge about it that way they can become intelligent with the history of the event. but some people never believed that the holocaust existed and others actually did.  \\n\\n therefore, a network of over 40,000 facilities in germany and occupied territory and was used to concentrate, hold and kill jews and other victims. in addition after the beginning of wwii, the nazi’s began ordering jews to live in certain areas of the cities in where many of them weren't allowed to leave at all. also many of the jews were held prisoners and had to be forced out of their residing locations and follow the orders of the nazis or they will have to face death, but the jews faced death anyways and about 5 million children were also killed during the holocaust due to hitler’s orders. also the first victims of the holocaust were homosexuals and people with disabilities and these victims were one of the first to be murdered during the event and there were also approximately more than 5 million non-jewish victims living in germany during wwii and as we said before the majority of them had to evacuate their places and relocate different areas. in addition there were different kinds of camps such as ghettos, concentration camps and even extermination camps where all the jews were sent and were never free from any of the camps, and the majority of all jews had to suffer being trapped in these places where they would be tortured and harmed intensely and later on face death due to their residence in the country where they weren't respected and treated kindly by the germans and especially hitler. also the jews were the scapegoats of germany collapsing after wwi meaning that the nazi’s blame the jews for the damage that has occurred to the country and germany wanted to gain more power in order for them to become a more powerful strong country. \\n\\n anne frank diary \\n\\n anne frank was a young girl that wrote every detail in a diary in her life of the holocaust. she was sending a message to everyone or to whom that finds the diary. i believe that she had a messenger, to tell her what was going on outside. anne frank was born in june 12, 1929, in frankfurt, germany. she was born as a jew, and bringing a jew was a very bad thing in the 1920’s because it was during world war i. she was hiding because herself and her family didn't want to get killed so the hide for a while in a tiny place. i don’t understand why would they do this to this poor girl and her family, that didn't do anything wrong? why hurt the jews? what did they do to get killed? \\n\\n change of the freedom writers \\n\\n should it’s amazing how the toast of change of the freedom writers has succeeded. from a group of students who didn't care about school and becoming someone important in life, to becoming someone better in life and helping other freshman students to do the same. most of the freedom writes shared the same story. they didn't care about school; they only care about surviving another day in long beach without getting killed. most of the freedom writes are teachers now in the area of long beach. many of them graduated from colleges, others are part of the freedom writers foundation. they should be the perfect example of success to most teenagers in high school. the reason why, is because it was then when it all started. from failing, ditching class, gang violence, poverty, and other domestic violence at home, to success. for the most part, most of them are doing very well. they are teachers, professors and other important positions someone can have. they are living the toast of change. \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n links \\n http://www.firststreetconfidential.com/images/images-history/0921-the-holocaust.jpg \\n http://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/ \\n http://images.publicradio.org/content/2009/08/12/20090812_anne_frank_33.jpg \\n http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=5438\",\n",

(see this last edit ) the editor was blocked for breaking 3rr. the person posted a reason on the talk page for the content blanking. but their reason just seems to say it was ok for them to delete the referenced text because another user said it was ok to do so. to me it just looks like an anti-jimmy page opinion edit and not an edit to help improve the page. could you look? i think the edit should be reverted. but the other day i noticed similar content removal and odd section altering so i reverted the back back to a version by y2kcrazyjoker as that appeared to be the last version that was stable. but i look today and see my edit was reverted by this tagged account and the edit summary claims my edit was some sort of sockpuppet edit. you can read the edit summary. to me it is very unclear. if you feel that person is up to something and revert his blanking i would be curious as to what names he chooses to call you? if i find a good chuck berry book in my travels i will post you. perhaps i can help you get that article into better shape. cheers and take care!\",\n",

(lee)  \\n\\n :sheeh. i apologize for not being more clear. i didn\\'t exactly expect you to go searching through miscellaneous site logs when i mentioned that someone from the foundation was attempting to contact colbert. the wikimedia fountation is, just to clear, the non-profit organization that handles wikipedia\\'s business and legal affairs. they\\'re seeking to contact him, actually, over events related to the previous night\\'s \"\"wikiality\"\" discussion on the report  this is something i heard through the grapevine and not anything i know much about  but i thought perhaps that if this site is indeed a scrappy little underdog of a marketing campaign for book whick colbert considers his baby, he or a representative might want to bother to have a fifteen minute discussion which would allow tek-related information to happily coexist with wikipedia\\'s policies. he doesn\\'t have to do anything he doesn\\'t want to, but since the folks at the tekjansen site seem to be somewhat preoccupied with the status of a single link here  and have us listed as their top referrer, despite the link being down half the time  i thought the option might be of interest. no, huh?
