        "# Overview\n",
        "For this capstone project I will be working on identifying online harassment using NLP.  Why focus on harassment?  Well, for starters, it's a problem that affects a quarter of the population in the U.S.  Additionally, according to a [2021 Pew research poll]( (https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/)), 79% of respondants \"say social media companies are doing an only fair or poor job at addressing online harassment or bullying on their platforms.\"  Our goal is to construct a virtual moderator, or vMOD, a NLP model that is capable of predicting if a comment is harassment or not, and automatically blocks users who are sending hateful comments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Fully 33% of women under 35 say they have been sexually harassed online\", For those who identify as LBGTQA, \"51% have been targeted for more severe forms of online abuse.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Among adults who have been harassed online, roughly half of women (47%) say they think they have encountered harassment online because of their gender, whereas 18% of men who have been harassed online say the same. Similarly, about half or more Black (54%) or Hispanic online harassment targets (47%) say they were harassed due to their race or ethnicity, compared with 17% of White targets.\"\n",
